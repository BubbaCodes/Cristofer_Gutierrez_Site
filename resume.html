            <p><img id="photo-of-me" src="Photos\Portrait_Cris.jpg" alt="Portrait of Cristofer Joan Gutierrez wearing a white coat, pink striped tie, and light blue shirt.">I am a family man with great motivation to succeed. Considered by former employers as a renaissance man with knowledge and skills beyond the duties required of me. Through dedication for knowledge and need, I’ve obtained many skills that allow me to succeed in academia and business. I was an artist before entering the wonderful world of STEM. I still draw, paint and find much of what inspires me in science. I was published in an interdisciplinary journal called, The May River Review, and in a poetry and short story publication called the Pen. I worked in the medical field as an Advance Emergency Medical Tech for 8 years. Starting from June of 2016 I Interned through the Pathways program that provides students with field experience working for a branch of government. I worked for the USDA-ARS, Southern Insect Management Research in Stoneville, Mississippi. I am also the father of a beautiful little girl that loves science inexplicably more than I could ever imagine. I am currently a senior at Florida International University. I also attended Delta State University and the University of South Carolina Beaufort campus. At USC-B I was VP for the Pre Professional Association, and was President for the Sociology Club. As student leadership, I mentored students and planned community wide events for social issues. I plan to complete my studies at a University that best compliments my goals. As a student at the University of South Carolina Beaufort, I assisted with class dissections for Anatomy and Physiology I & II. I mentored fellow students and was the leader of a few study groups. Throughout the time at USC-B I maintained a 3.7 GPA and was awarded the chancellor’s list every semester of attendance. As a paramedic student, I tutored fellow paramedic students in ACLS and ASLS. I was an art teacher for Boys & Girls Club of Ridgeland and Hilton Head Island Art Academy. I have customer service experience from all aspects of my work history. From retail to EMS, communication and social awareness have been crucial to my success. Thank you for taking the time to learn a little about me.
